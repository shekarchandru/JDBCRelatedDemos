Type1 Driver JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver

The JDBC-ODBC bridge driver uses ODBC driver to connect to the database. The JDBC-ODBC bridge driver converts JDBC method calls into the ODBC function calls. This is now discouraged because of thin driver.

Advantages:
easy to use.
can be easily connected to any database.

Disadvantages:
Performance degraded because JDBC method call is converted into the ODBC function calls.
The ODBC driver needs to be installed on the client machine.
---------------------------------------
2)Native-API Driver -partially java driver

The Native API driver uses the client-side libraries of the database. The driver converts JDBC method calls into native calls of the database API. It is not written entirely in java.

Advantage:
performance upgraded than JDBC-ODBC bridge driver.

Disadvantage:
The Native driver needs to be installed on the each client machine.
The Vendor client library needs to be installed on client machine.
------------------------------------------
3) Network-Protocol Driver -fully java driver
The Network Protocol driver uses middleware (application server) that converts JDBC calls directly or indirectly into the vendor-specific database protocol. It is fully written in java.

Advantage:
No client side library is required because of application server that can perform many tasks like auditing, load balancing, logging etc.

Disadvantages:
Network support is required on client machine.
Requires database-specific coding to be done in the middle tier.
Maintenance of Network Protocol driver becomes costly because it requires database-specific coding to be done in the middle tier.
--------------------------------------------
4) Thin Driver -fully java driver

The thin driver converts JDBC calls directly into the vendor-specific database protocol. That is why it is known as thin driver. It is fully written in Java language.

Advantage:
Better performance than all other drivers.
No software is required at client side or server side.

Disadvantage:
Drivers depend on the Database.
